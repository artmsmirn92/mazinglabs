                <p><b><script>write_company_name();</script></b> ("us", "we", or "our") operates <b>Maze Blade - Traps and Puzzles</b> mobile application (the "Game" or "App").</p>
                <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Game and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
                <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h2>
                <p>Most of the information that we collect about you comes directly from you when you play our Game or interact with third-party ads in our Game. In general, the information we collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how you play our Game. We may also collect information from app store platforms and partners and other third parties such as information about your interests and in-app purchases (provided that we never receive your payment or credit card information).</p>
                <p>The information that we may collect about you through the Game broadly falls into the following categories:</p>
                <h3>(a) Information that we collect automatically</h3>
                <p>When you use our Game, we may also collect certain information automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data and analytics about your use of our Game (e.g. in-game play progress, levels, games played, session length, preferred settings, which in-game adverts you may have viewed, in-game references or just game preferences, the means by which you were referred to our Game)</li>
                    <li>Your IP address and device identifiers such as your Advertising ID, Device ID numbers</li>
                    <li>Your device type and the operating system that you use</li>
                    <li>Broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) based on your IP address</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Advertising ID</em> means Apple Identifier for Advertisers (“IDFA”) on Apple and Google Advertising Identity (“GAID”). These are unique identifiers for mobile device that advertisers use for personalized advertising. They are consistent across all mobile applications and thus allow cross-app tracking. On Apple, you can opt out of it by choosing “limit ad tracking” option in your privacy settings. On Google Android, you can opt out of these ads by choosing “Opt-out of personalized ads”. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers, which are uniquely associated with your device.</p>
                <p><em>Device identifier / information</em> means device type, device model, device maker, device operating system and its language or other technical data like screen size or processor, or combination of this data available from a device for a developer for checking the device compatibility with a particular application.</p>
                <p>Some of this information may be collected through cookies as explained further under the heading Cookies below.</p>

                <h2>4. ADVERTISING</h2>
                <h3>4.1. In General</h3>
                <p>We use advertising to fund our Game and to make our Game available for free. We offer our Game for free and in order to do that we need to share information we collect from you with our third-party advertising partners. As a safeguard to protect your privacy, we only store personal information temporarily. The information collected helps us to improve our Game and – at the same time – keep our Game free for a wide player base.</p>
                <p>Before sharing any information with our advertising partners for the purposes of personalized advertising, we always ask for your consent, given when you press "Allow" or "ACCEPT" at relevant button at loading of the Game. The purpose is to improve our Games and provide the player with more relevant ads. We allow our advertising partners to show personalized ads to you only if you have pressed "Allow" in relevant pop-up window and so consented to the sharing of your personal information for the purposes of personalized advertising. Our advertising partners use different technologies for the purposes of personalized advertising that process your personal information in different ways, so please review their data processing practices before you "Allow" or "ACCEPT" to show you personalized ads at loading of the Game. The list of our current advertising partners with links to their privacy policies is available <script>get_link_thirdparty("here");</script>.</p>

You can withdraw your consent by going to the Game settings and clicking the terms & Privacy button therein, in section ‘Personalized Ads Consent Withdrawal’ of the Privacy Policy you will be able to manage your preferences by choosing to which advertising you would like to get. When you decide to withdraw your consent or if you do not provide your consent, you may still see the same number of ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because they won’t be based on topics you like, your interest, behavior, demographics, etc. Our advertising partners may continue to show you ads based on the content of the application you are using.</p>
                <h3>4.2 In-game advertising (i.e. when you view ads in our Game)</h3>
                <p>To enable us to show in-game ads, we may send your advertising ID and IP-address to advertisers (or ad networks) to enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our game and on third-party properties. You can control and limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. We do not control which specific ads are shown in our game (it is controlled by ad networks), but we do blacklist certain categories of ads.</p>
                <p>Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our advertising partners listed <script>get_link_thirdparty("here");</script>) including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>limit the number of times you see the same ad;</li>
                    <li>ensure they are dealing with humans with real devices and not ‘automated’ bots;</li>
                    <li>serve you with advertisements likely to be relevant to you based on your advertising ID engagement with other brands and ads, also recorded using your advertising ID and using your general geographic area. Other brands buy advertisement placement via an ad network or ad exchange to advertise their products in our Game. The ad network or ad exchange acts as intermediary between the other game companies and Us. In order for an ad network to charge the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially installs of other developers’ applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, and installs from ads are measured using Advertiser ID;</li>
                    <li>keep track what games you have used to market you similar kind of games. IP-address is typically used by advertisers to broadly see the general geographic area you are coming from for example country, state, and sometimes at city level).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4.3. View of Our ads on third-party services</h3>
                <p>We also advertise the Game in other apps by asking ad networks to serve them to audiences that will be interested in them (determined using Advertising IDs).</p>
                <p>The Advertising IDs are used by the ad networks for a number of purposes (please refer to the Privacy Notices of our advertising partners listed <script>get_link_thirdparty("here");</script>) including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>measuring ad effectiveness (looking at aggregated views, clicks and installs they generate through their advertising in other publishers’ games);</li>
                    <li>informing players, that have not been playing for a while, about new content in the Game. We give a list of these users in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then shows these users ads about the new content;</li>
                    <li>not showing ads on a game which a player is already playing. We can send a list of active players in the form of Advertising IDs to an ad network. Ad network then excludes these players from seeing the ad;</li>
                    <li>marketing games to a group of potential players.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>4.4. WHO CAN SHOW PERSONALIZED ADS TO YOU?</h2>
                <p>Please see the list of advertising providers that are allowed to show personalized advertising and review their data processing practices, including the technologies they use for the purposes of personalized advertising <script>get_link_thirdparty("here");</script>.</p>
                <h2>4.5 HOW CAN YOU TURN OFF PERSONALIZED ADS?</h2>
                <p>Besides specific instruments available to users via the Game you can use your device settings.</p>
                <h3>iOS</h3>
                <p>Open the “Settings” application of iOS and select the “Privacy” menu item and then the “Advertising” sub-item. If you activate the “Limit ad tracking” option, we can only take limited measures such as identifying unique users or combating fraud.

                <h3>Android</h3>

From there, select the “Ads” sub-item and activate the option “Opt out of Ads Personalisation” to prevent the creation of profiles and the display of personalized advertising. You can delete the advertising ID in the same menu at any time (“Reset advertising ID”), then a new ID will be created which will not be merged with the previously collected data.</p>
